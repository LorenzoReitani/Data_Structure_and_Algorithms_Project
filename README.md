# Data Structure and Algorithms Final Exam @ Polimi 🧑‍💻

Impletentation of an algorithm (in C) to fulfill correctness and efficiency specs

## Goal 🏎️

The project aims to plan the shortest route with the fewest stops between two given service stations on a highway. Each service station has a unique distance from the start of the highway and offers electric rental vehicles with a specified range. A journey consists of consecutive stops at service stations, with the driver unable to backtrack and renting a new vehicle at each stop. The objective is to find the route with the minimum number of stops, favoring routes with shorter distances from the start of the highway in case of ties. Routes are represented as sequences of distances from the start of the highway, and the chosen route must not have another route with the same final sequence of stops preceded by a station with a shorter distance.

## Implementation 

The solution is implemented as a variation of Dijkstra Shortest Path algorithm. In addition the main data structures used are BSTs, queues, variation of Max-Heaps.
